                <p>Flyblox is a community site and we rely on your reports and feedback because it helps to shape the site and keep it friendly, safe, up to date and better overall experience for you. We like to think of it as you, the Flyblox community, and keeping out the bad guys like scammers.

                    While most Flyblox users have great success buying, selling,  connecting with others, sometimes we do receive reports of people trying to scam or defraud users.

                    If you find an ad on Flyblox that you think is illegal, or a scam or fraud you can report to us by clicking on the ‘Report’ button shown on every Flyblox ad. Reporting a suspicious ad brings it to our attention so that we can review and, if necessary, take it down quickly. Or contact us via contact us page.

                    If you reply to an ad and you get a suspicious request from the poster of the ad (e.g. requests for crypto to be sent directly to self-hosted wallet, phishing link or a payment service that is not in Flyblox’s please forward the email to us and stop all contact with that person. As its most likely a scam and could be malware. Make sure all payments are processed through our smart contract on Metamask.

                    If you experience harassment or abuse in connection with either an ad on Flyblox or an email received from a Flyblox user then please report it to us by the contact us page
